## SymTensor: An Efficient Abstraction for Group-Symmteric Tensor Contractions


## Building and Testing

### Requirements

Build-time dependencies of the SymTensor package are:

* NumPy
* [tensorbackends](https://github.com/cyclops-community/tensorbackends)

The library may be installed into a Python environment from the main source directory via
```sh
pip install .
```
To test the library

SymTensor may be used with NumPy, cuPy, or [Cyclops Tensor Framework](https://github.com/cyclops-community/ctf) as a backend.
To import a given backend into symtensor the command
```sh
FIXME
```
may be used.
